# Unsupervised-Learning

Background
A medical research company is interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. Raw data is first cleaned and processed to be used with machine learning models. Several clustering algorithms are used to explore whether the patients' data can be placed into distinct groups. Visualizations are also provided.

Feature reduction was used on the dataset to improve the model.
